# final_portfolio_N_Patience
For the portfolio project I would like to work on an order management system for a grocery or supermarket kind of store. I would like to create a system that manages the drive up and pick up orders. Iâ€™d like to manage the data coming into the program when a customer places an order as well as manage how the order is processed by the store.
The way that the order is processed would differ depending on the kind of order i.e. pick up or drive up as the one requires more specifications from the customer as to what time they will pick up the order and where the order should be placed in their vehicle, etc.

I need to think about the kind of inventory I will have in this system as for the purposes of this project I will have to limit it quite a lot being a smaller version of what this project could potentially be.

I will also need to look into the kinds of users I will have and how I will manage the store side versus the client side and how much of my work will be based on the client as I would like to focus on how the store side operates and potentially just have mock users that are manipulated in different ways to show the store side of the management system.
